Single-progenitor dynamics in squamous epithelial tissues.
Computational methods used for cell-fate model simulations, inference and fitting of experimental data, organized in three categories:
- **Clonal-Lineage-Inference**: inference on clonal dynamics
- **H2BGFP-ModalityTests**: inference on cell proliferation heterogeneity through modality tests
- **H2BGFP-tcc-Inference**: inference on cell cycle time and division rate of proliferating cell populations
